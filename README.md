A project for image and video generation of Newton's Fractal.

Newton's Fractal is created by looking at points z in the complex plane, and applying Newton's method with an initial value of z. By colour coding each pixel based on which root of the function the starting point is attracted to, a fractal is generated.

CUDA and non-CUDA versions are provided. Video generation scripts all require CUDA support, otherwise generation time would be extremely slow.
